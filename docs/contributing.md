# Contributing

The main goal of this project is the standalone widget remains as closely as
possible to SublimeText3, my favourite text editor of all times. If you don't
feel good while coding in SublimeText maybe this project is not for you :)

One of the most important things to me though is every single person that decides
to invest their valuable time on this project will have fun by doing so, if that's
not the case definitely there is something wrong that needs to be addressed,
the fun factor is key to me as I think thanks to that everyone who's interested on
this project will benefit from it in the long term.

I'll be doing the whole code refactoring after you push your commits so you don't
need to worry about things that will make you waste your time, just get assigned
some open issue, code it, test it (or not) and submit it... If your favourite
feature is not implemented yet, of course, just open the issue :)

Don't even worry about providing commit messages, a blank message will be good
enough, the most important is to get the job done and make the widget to feel
like you're coding in SublimeText itself, that's all

Happy coding :D !!!
